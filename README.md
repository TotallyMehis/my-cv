# NodeJS app to build my static CV site

As seen on [the site](https://cv.mehis.dev/).

## Building & Installation
1. Run `npm install` once.
2. Run `npm start` to do full build. Output in `_site`-directory.

## Development
Run `npm run dev` when modifying files.
To skip unnecessary steps run `npx eleventy` when changing `.pug` or `.yml` files.

### TODO

- Proper development environment :)
- Use some front-end framework (material design?)
