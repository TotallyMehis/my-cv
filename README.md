# NodeJS app to build my static CV site

As seen on [the site](https://cv.mehis.dev/).

## Building & Installation
1. Run `npm install` once.
2. Run `npm run build` to do a full build. Output is in `_site`-directory.

## Development

```bash
# Start serving eleventy
npm run serve:eleventy

# Start webpack serving. Only start after eleventy is done building.
npm run serve:webpack

# You can now connect to localhost:8080
```

### TODO

- Use some front-end framework (material design?)
