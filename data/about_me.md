I have been modding games since 12 years old, which sparked my interest in programming. Creating things, whether through code or something else, is a rewarding experience to me. I always have something in the works, or something new I'm learning.

I'm an avid drum & bass, jungle and breakbeat listener. Not to be one note, I'm also a big Pink Floyd and Radiohead fan. To clear my head from work and sitting all day (or if I'm using a standing desk, from excessive music jamming ðŸ˜‚), I swim.
