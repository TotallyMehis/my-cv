My name is Miikka Yl√§talo, and I live in Finland. I'm mostly known as Mehis on the web, hence the name of the site. I mod games and maintain game servers as a hobby.
When I'm not working on my projects, you can find me messing around with older games. For the background noise I have electronic music, mostly drum & bass and ambient.
