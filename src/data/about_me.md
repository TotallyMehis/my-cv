My name is Miikka Ylätalo, I'm 25 years old and I live in Riihimäki, Finland. I'm mostly known as Mehis on the web, hence the name of the site. You can find me modding games and maintaining game servers on my free time. When I'm not working on my projects, you might catch me messing around with older games. Hit me up, if you play Quake 2 😋. I like to jam to music while I work on things. I mostly listen to drum & bass and ambient genres. It's safe to say that I can't promise a quiet working environment. 😂
