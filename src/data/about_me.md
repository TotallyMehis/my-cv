My name is Miikka YlÃ¤talo, I'm 22 years old and I live in RiihimÃ¤ki, Finland. I'm mostly known as Mehis on the web, hence the name of the site. You can find me modding games and maintaining game servers on my free time. When I'm not working on my projects, you might catch me messing around with older games. Hit me up, if you play Quake 2 or Age of Empires 2 ðŸ˜‹. I believe life would be boring without some music. Fortunately, I have electronic music that fills the gap. Mostly drum & bass and ambient genres.
